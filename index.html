                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Zubin Mulji and I have had a strange and exciting journey to becoming a programmer. I
                        started out at New
                        York
                        University-Stern School of Business studying math and finance. Pretty soon I had found out about
                        another program at
                        NYU,
                        the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. At the time, I was an electronic music producer and
                        DJ on the side, and
                        was
                        presented with an opportunity to pursue my passion in a concrete way. So by winter break, I was
                        working on my
                        audition
                        material, and by the end of the year was accepted as a new transfer student into the program.
                    </p>
                    <p>While working towards a BFA in Music Production, I also picked up a minor in Web Programming and
                        Applications at NYU to
                        find an outlet for my more technical interests. After graduating, I worked as a recording
                        engineer in New York City
                        music studios, working with singers, rappers, instrumentalists, etc. While the trade is more
                        creative than technical, it
                        taught me how to learn new skills quickly and how to work under pressure to meet a client's
                        needs.
                    </p>
                    <p>The problem-solving element of my work was fun, but I found myself missing the intellectual
                        stimulation that I got in
                        my calculus and coding classes. So I took a step back from my music work to focus my energy on
                        becoming a skilled
                        programmer, with hopes of writing new and innovative applications to find solutions for
                        creatives and executives in
                        music, entertainment, and beyond.</p>
